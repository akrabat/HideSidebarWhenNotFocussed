HideSidebarWhenNotFocussed is now SideBarHider.

We decided to give the plugin a shorter more handy name. Here it is. From now on HideSidebarWhenNotFocussed is just
SideBarHider.

Also as a new feature you can now toggle the autohiding for the current window.
Search the CommandPalette for **SideBarHider**.

Or just use the shortcut:
**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+t** [Windows + MacOS + Linux]
